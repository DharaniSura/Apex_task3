# 🚀 Apex_Task3: Working with External APIs Using JavaScript

This project showcases how to fetch and display real-time data from public APIs using **JavaScript**. It focuses on asynchronous programming, working with the `fetch()` API, and dynamically updating content on a webpage.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- **Learn to integrate external APIs into a frontend project**
- **Use JavaScript's `fetch()` method and async/await for API calls**
- **Dynamically update the DOM with real-time data**
- **Implement error handling and user-friendly messaging**

## 🛠️ What I Built

### 1. API Integration
- Connected to a public API ([e.g., Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/) or [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api))
- Fetched real-time data using JavaScript's `fetch()` function
- Parsed and displayed the JSON response on the webpage

### 2. Dynamic Content Rendering
- Injected API response content into the DOM without page reloads
- Styled the display elements using CSS for a clean layout
- Built an interactive interface where users can trigger new API requests (e.g., "Get another joke" button)

### 3. Error Handling
- Handled common issues like network errors and API failures
- Displayed appropriate error messages for improved UX

## ✅ Key Learnings
- How to fetch and consume data from third-party APIs
- Understanding promises, `then()` vs `async/await`
- Using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM based on dynamic data
- Error handling and UX considerations for API-based content
